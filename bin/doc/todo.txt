Principles : 

SR - The Single Responsibility Principle -
      A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

OCP - The Open Closed Principle -
      You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

LSP - The Liskov Substitution Principle -
      Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

DIP - The Dependency Inversion Principle -
      Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

ISP - The Interface Segregation Principle -
      Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
